# databases_final_project

## Overview

This project is the creation of a sushi restaurant data generator and data manager. Scraping ingredients for various sushi items using the Edamam API, the program then populates a Django-based restaurant application with this data. The application includes models for: menu items, ingredients, allergies, orders and payments, providing our idea of the implementation of a database for a sushi restaurant.

## Features

- Uses Python scripts to generate ingredients and menu items.
- Loads sushi menu information into a Django application.
- Manages dietary requirements and allergies for every dish on the menu.
