# databases_final_project

## Overview

This project is the creation of a sushi restaurant data generator and data manager. It scrapes ingredients for various sushi items using the Edamam API and populates a Django-based restaurant application with this data. The application includes models for: menu items, ingredients, allergies, orders and payments, providing our idea of the implementation of a database for a sushi restaurant.
